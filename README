---------  Basic test coverage for JBossTS XTS Demo App
Author: Ivo Studensky <istudens@redhat.com>

This is some basic test coverage for the XTS Demo App. It is powered by Arquillian
and its Drone extension. By default it calls a local Firefox browser to execute the tests.

The test starts up the AS, deploys the XTS Demo App into it and runs a reservation of some
restaurant/theatre/taxi seats using both AtomicTransaction and BusinessActivity tx type.


--- Steps to run:

1. git clone git@github.com:istudens/xtsdemo-test.git
2. cd xtsdemo-test
3. export JBOSS_HOME=<path to JBossAS >= 7.1.0.Alpha2-SNAPSHOT>
4. mvn clean test
